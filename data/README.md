We use the large-scale Perturb-seq data from Norman et al., 2019 (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax4438).

We use the preprocessed version by CPA (https://github.com/facebookresearch/CPA), which can be downloaded with `wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/dlp/cpa_binaries.tar` and extracted with `tar -xvf cpa_binaries.tar`.

The dataset should be placed inside `./datasets/` as `./datasets/Norman2019_raw.h5ad`.
